Work with data captured with VideoIMUCapture-Android - https://github.com/DavidGillsjo/VideoIMUCapture-Android

First process using COLMAP, then recover scale and orientation using IMU data

To recover camera pose using COLMAP:
- cd to the directory generated by VideoIMUCapture-Android (the one with`video_recording.mp4` and `video_meta.pb3`)
- Extract frames using `extract_frames.py`
- Follow comments in `colmap_commands.bash` to generate a sparse reconstruction

To recover scale and orientation:
- Make sure you have `timestamps.json`, `transforms.json`, and `video_meta.pb3` in the working directory
- Run `train.py` to train scale and gravity-aligned orientation

Configuration file is `config.yaml`.
