        <p style="color:#888">Harry Chen - Nov. 23, 2020</p>

        <p>My artwork is a series of renderings of the same digital model of a pair of eyes placed on a plane. When
            creating this artwork, I connect the school assignment with my interest, computer programming and
            computer-generated imagery. I wanted to try something I haven’t tried before, that is, scalar field
            triangulation and Monte-Carlo path tracing. I modeled the eyelash like water droplets and made the eyes from
            glass because I have always been fascinated with water and glass-like solids. I experimented with different
            viewport settings, surfaces, and lightings to create images that bring people different feelings. I also
            tried direct light sampling and subsurface scattering to challenge myself.</p>

            <span id="caption">“In Your Eyes.” One of the series of renderings.</span>
        </p>

        <p>My artwork is a series of Computer Generated Imagery (CGI) of a stylized eye model. It is a series of images
            of the same model rendered using Monte-Carlo path tracing. The model is a polygonised procedural scalar
            field reconstructed using the Matching Cube algorithm. When creating this artwork, I didn’t use any
            third-party CGI software or libraries. Instead, I created it completely within the Microsoft Visual Studio
            IDE.</p>
        <p>When I started working on the eye drawing project, I tried several sketches and digital drawings but they
            didn't look well. I am a computer graphics enthusiast who enjoys doing art by coding, so I decided to try
            doing this project using CGI. Initially I didn’t have much hope that it would work, because I had never
            tried scalar field polygonising and Monte-Carlo path tracing. I regarded it as an opportunity to try
            something new, and thought about the possibility that I would hand in a drawing instead if it wouldn’t work
            out well. However, my first full-resolution rendering surprised me. I then tried different angles and
            surfaces, and experimented with some more “advanced” concepts like direct light sampling, motion blur, and
            subsurface scattering, and was again surprised to find a simple eye model can have so many possibilities
            that brings a viewer different feelings when rendered differently.</p>
        <p>I have been fascinated with water, light caustics, and glass-like solids, so I decided to create the eyes
            made of glass. When modeling the eye, I made it not too complicated or detailed but better described as
            stylized. I made the eyelash look like spilled water droplets, and in most images the eyes are rendered as
            glass. I tried different angles and perspectives as well as materials and lightings in the rendering. To
            find some challenge, I also experimented with diffuse reflection and subsurface scattering. Overall, I had
            fun doing this project and feel I learned a lot in the process.</p>

            <span id="caption">Second rendering. In the image, the ground is specular and the eyes are diffuse. I like
                how the darkest part of the background is directly behind the eyes makes the scene look 3d.</span>

            <span id="caption">I didn’t pay much attention when creating this pair of eyes; I just tried to color
                different parts of the eyes from my imagination and they worked out well (personally think). The
                background doesn’t look pretty nice and I attempted to fix it in later renderings.</span>

            <span id="caption">I experimented with direct light sampling and motion blur in this scene. There is
                background light in this scene, but the dominant light source is a small moving sphere with high
                brightness, which requires direct light sampling to be rendered efficiently. I set up this scene to see
                how the diffuse surfaces are illuminated and the natural soft shadow. I make the color of the light
                slightly warm to make the scene give people a warm feeling.</span>

            <span id="caption">Experiment with subsurface scattering. The iris is actually a thin hollow layer inside
                the eyeball, it appears to be white when subsurface scattering is added. In the first picture, the
                background appears to be too dark. In the second picture I increased the perspective trying to fix it
                naturally. However, it slightly distorted the eyes.</span>

            <span id="caption">Combining subsurface scattering with bulb light. There is an emissive sphere with high
                intensity in front of the eye, and I hid it from the first light bounce. Since the scene is dominated by
                indirect light, direct light sampling doesn’t work well; I need much more ray samples (1024spp) and each
                image takes around 20mins to render. I think bidirectional path tracing can solve this problem.</span>
